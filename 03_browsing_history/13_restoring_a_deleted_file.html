          <p>We can restore files that we deleted in previous commits. Suppose that we accidentally removed <em>app.py</em> and now we need it back. The first thing that we need to do is find the last commit where that file was not deleted. To do that we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git log --oneline -- app.py</code>
          </div>
          <p>So far...nothing new. Now, since the file will show up on the commit in which we delete it, the last commit were the file was not deleted is the second commit from the top. So, commit <em>8eec1d2</em>. What we need to do now is to <span class="inline-code">git checkout</span> just that file from that commit. So we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git checkout 8eec1d2 app.py</code>
          </div>
          <p>Git will take the file as it was at that point in time and place it in our staging area. That is why if we run a <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> we can see that the file has an <span class="git-green">A</span> on the left column. Lastly, we commit the file to the repository.</p>
