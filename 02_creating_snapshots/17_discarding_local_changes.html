          <p>To discard local changes (ie changes in our working directory) from a file that is already been tracked, we run</p>

            <code>git restore <em>file_name.ext</em></code>
          </div>
          <p>Same as before, Git will take the version of this file that is in the next environment. Since we are on the working directory now, the next environment is the staging area.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Note that <em>file3.txt</em> was not restored to its previous state. This is because this file is new, so there is no previous state. Going back to the "previous version" of this file means deleting it. To do this we run</p>

            <code>git clean -fd</code>

          <p>The <span class="inline-code">-fd</span> switch is necessary because by default Git will not allow us to delete untracked files (since they can not be recovered). The <span class="inline-code">f</span> switch is mandatory here and it means <span class="inline-code">force</span>. So we are forcing Git to go ahead with the removal. The <span class="inline-code">d</span> switch is necessary for deleting entire untracked subdirectories.</p>
