          <p>The <span class="inline-code">git status -s</span> only tells us which files have changed. To explore what we have in the staging area we use</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git diff --staged</code>
          </div>
          <p>The first line of this output tells us that that <span class="inline-code">diff</span> utility was called to compare two versions of <em>file1.txt</em>. The copy prefixed with <span class="inline-code">a</span> is the old copy (the one we had in the last commit). The copy prefixed with <span class="inline-code">b</span> is the one we have in the staging area. Next we have a legent with the IDs. After that there's a line with <span class="inline-code">--- a/file1.txt</span> and another one with <span class="inline-code">+++ b/file1.txt</span>. Changes to the old copy are prefixed with minus signs and changes to the new copy are prefixed with plus signs. After that there's a header with information about what parts of the files have changed. This is because Git will not show all the file (if it's too long), just a chunk. Every chunk has a header that looks like that. The first part of the header says <span class="inline-code">-1,3</span>. This means Git is showing lines 1 through 3 of the old copy.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">
          <p>The second part of the header says <span class="inline-code">+1,5</span>. This means Git is showing us lines 1 through 5 of the new copy. Below that we can see the difference between the two of them. The <span class="git-green">+sky</span> and <span class="git-green">+ocean</span> mean that those two lines are new lines that are being added in the new version of the file.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">
          <p>Now we'll compare two versions of <em>file2.txt</em>. In this case Git is showing <span class="inline-code">--- /dev/null</span> along with a header of <span class="inline-code">-0,0</span> because the file is new. So, from the "previous" (none-existing) version is pulling lines 0 through 0.</p>

          <p>If instead we wish to compare files in the working area to files in the staging area, we use to the same command by without the <span class="inline-code">--staged</span> option. So:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git diff</code>
          </div>
          <p>Here Git is telling us that in <em>file1.txt</em> the first two lines (<span class="git-red">hello</span> and <span class="git-red">world</span>) were removed, and replaces by a new line (<span class="git-green">hello world</span>).</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">
          <p>As you may have probably guessed already, this is not how we inspect changes. To inspect changes we use a <em>diff tool</em>. Here we'll use VS Code. So first we need to set VS Code as our default diff tool. To do that, we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git config --global diff.tool vscode</code>
          </div>
          <p>With this command we are just giving a name to our default <em>diff tool</em>. Now we need to tell Git how to launch our diff tool. To do this we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"</code>
          </div>
          <p>For this to work remember that you must have added VS Code to your system path. If you forgot about that, the easiest way is to just reinstall VS Code and check the add to PATH checkbox on the installation wizard. <span class="inline-code">code</span> just tells the command prompt that it needs to open VS Code. The <span class="inline-code">--wait</span> option tells the command propmt it needs to wait until we are done with VS Code. The <span class="inline-code">--diff</span> option tells VS Code that we want to use it for <em>diffing</em> files. Lastly, <span class="inline-code">$LOCAL</span> and <span class="inline-code">$REMOTE</span> are place holders for the older and newer versions fo the file.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="left-col">
           <p>To check that everything went OK, just run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git config --global -e</code>
          </div>
          <p>This will open the Git settings in VS Code. You should see the commands we just run at the bottom of the file. Make sure that they are just as we typed them. So <em>tool = vscode</em> and <em>cmd = "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"</em>. If there are any mistakes, you can correct them there. Just remeber to save your changes before closing.</p>

        <div class="right-col">

      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">
          <p>Now all we need to do is to change the <span class="inline-code">diff</span> part of our command with <span class="inline-code">difftool</span> and select <span class="inline-code">Y</span> when prompeted by Git Bash. This will open VS Code with both versions of our file placed side by side. The old copy that we have in the staging area is shown on the left panel, and the new copy that we have in the working directory is shown on the right-hand side panel.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">

      <div class="row">
        <div class="single-col">
          <p>Now we can take a look at the diffs in the staging area by running</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git difftool --staged</code>
          </div>
          <p>In this case the old copy (left) is what we had on the last commit, and the new copy (right) is what we have on the staging area. If more than one file is afected then, once we are done with the first one and close VS Code, Git Bash will ask as if we want to look at the other one.</p>
