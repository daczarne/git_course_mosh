          <p>Now we have a snapshot in the <em>Staging Area</em> that is ready to be permanently saved in the <em>Repository</em>. To do this we run</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git commit -m "Commit Message"</code>
          </div>
          <p>Here the <span class="inline-code">-m</span> flag means that we are providing a message. The message itself is what we type in quotes. This will only let us write a short one-line message. If we need longer messages we omit the flag, and Git will open our text editor, where we can enter a more detailed message.</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>git commit</code>

          <p>Now on VS Code, we can write our <span class="inline-code">commit</span> message. On the first line, we should write the title of our commit or a short description of it. This description should not exceed 80 characters.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Then we write a long description that explains what was changed, delete, or added in this <span class="inline-code">commit</span>. When done, we save the changes and close VS Code. Keep in mind that when we close VS Code the <span class="inline-code">commit</span> command is executed, so make sure to double-check your message and make sure you included everything that needs to be included.</p>

          <p>Back in Git Bash, we'll see a message with basic statistics of what was changed. Here it says that two files were changed: <em>file1.txt</em> and <em>file2.txt</em>. It also says that there were three insertions (one for each time we added <em>hello</em> to each file and one for when we added <em>world</em> to <em>file1.txt</em>).</p>
