              GitHub Actions is a tool that allows you to automate development
              workflows. Each task is called an <em>action</em>. A combination
              of tasks is called a <em>workflow</em>. Workflows can be triggered
              in different ways: push, pull requests (opened and/or merged),
              issues (created, closed, etc), on a specific schedule, or due to
              external events.

              The workflows will be run in a virtual machine on the GitHub
              servers. A workflow can contain one or more <em>jobs</em>, and
              each job will run in its own virtual machine. These virtual
              machines can use Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and have different
              tools installed, and even run Docker Containers. Jobs can be run
              in parallel, or we can specify dependencies between them.

              A <em>runner</em> is any virtual machine with the GitHub actions
              application installed. The runner is responsible for running the
              job whenever the triggering conditions are met, and for displaying
              back the results. You can use GitHub's runners, or host your own
              ones. GitHub hosted runners are maintained by GitHub, but we
              cannot customize the hardware configurations. They also come with
              some pre-installed tools like <i>curl</i>, <i>git</i>, <i>npm</i>,
              <i>yarn</i>, <i>pip</i>, etc, and languages and tools like Python,
              Ruby, node.JS, etc.

              Workflows must be written in YAML and placed inside
              <em>.github/workflows</em> directory in the root of the project.
              This files are composed of key:value pairs, with keys separated
              from values by colons <em>:</em>. To nest objects inside of other
              objects in YAML we just need to indent the keys of the child
              object with 2 or 4 spaces with respect to the keys of its parent
              object.
            </p>

              Each YAML file in the <em>workflows</em> directory contains the
              instructions for one workflow. The first key that we have to
              specify is <em>name</em>. The value we pass to it will become the
              name of the workflow and GitHub will display it in the Actions
              tab.

              After the <em>name</em> we'll specify the dispatch mode of the
              action using the <em>on</em> key. The value of the <em>on</em> key
              can be a single value (for example, use <em>push</em> for a
              workflow that needs to be dispatched with every push), an array of
              values (for example, use <em>[workflow_dispatch, push]</em> for a
              workflow that needs to be dispatched with every push, but also
              needs to be able to be manually dispatched), or an object
              specifying more complex conditions or to alter the behavior of a
              pre-defined dispatch mode.

              After the <em>name</em> and <em>on</em> keys, we need to start
              defining the jobs in our workflow. To do so we use the
              <em>jobs</em> key. To it we'll need to supply an array of objects
              (each element in the array representing a job) where the first key
              is the name of the job and takes as its value an object containing
              all the specifications of the job.
