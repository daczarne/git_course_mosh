              When you log on to GitHub, you'll see your home page. On the
              left-hand panel you can find your repositories (top) and your
              teams (bottom). On the main panel you can see your recent activity
              (top) and the recent activity of people you follow or repositories
              you've stared. On the right-hand panel GitHub will recommend other
              repositories you might be interested in.

              Here you can create a new repository. Mandatory fields have a red
              asterisk next to them. If you've created
              <em>template repositories</em> and want to create a new repository
              based on one of your templates you can choose so at the top. A
              <em>template repository</em> is a repository that already comes
              with certain files and directories. Usually, you will create
              templates for things you do quite often and that share some common
              structure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After choosing a <em>name</em> and (optionally) a
              <em>description</em> for your repository, you need to choose
              whether it will be public or private. Public repos can be seen by
              anyone, but you can still manage who has <em>push access</em> to
              them. Private repositories can only be seen by you and by those
              with whom you choose to share it with (by adding them as
              collaborators). You can manage different levels of privileges for
              contributors on private repos.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Below this there are three checkboxes. The README file is a
              Markdown file where you can explain how to use the repository. Its
              content will be displayed on the repos code tab (more on that
              later). I suggest you always create all repositories with a README
              file. Next, you can choose to add a <em>.gitignore</em> file. If
              you do so, a dropdown menu will appear where you can choose the
              language. These are templates that already come with a list of the
              files you should normally ignore when working on the selected
              language. I suggest you always create all repos with a
              <em>.gitignore file</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Lastly, you can choose a template LICENSE file. These are usually
              only used on open-source projects.
            </p>

              After clicking on the <em>Create Repository</em> button at the
              bottom of the page, GitHub will create a new repository for you.
              If you selected either a README, gitignore, or LICENSE then GitHub
              will also create the first commit (with an
              <em>Initial commit</em> message) and create those files for you.

              If you need to add collaborators to the repository, go to
              <em>Settings > Manage Access > Invite Collaborator</em>. You can
              search for them by name, user name, or email address. Once you add
              them, they will receive an invite via email where they can choose
              to accept or ignore your invitation.
